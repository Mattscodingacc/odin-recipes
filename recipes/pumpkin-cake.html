    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Easy Pumpkin Cake is our favorite, fluffy, moist and absolutely delicious pumpkin cake. 
        It has a tender, moist and delicate crumb. 
        The marshmallow-like whipped cream cheese frosting takes it over the top.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking soda (sifted to get rid of lumps)</li>
        <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>2 tsp cinnamon</li>
        <li>3 large eggs, room temp</li>
        <li>1 cup oil (extra light olive oil, vegetable or corn oil will work)</li>
        <li>1 can (15 oz) pumpkin puree</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients: 2 cups flour, 1 1/2 cups sugar, 1 tsp baking soda, 2 tsp baking powder, 2 tsp cinnamon.</li>
        <li>In a second medium bowl, whisk together wet ingredients: 3 large eggs, 1 cup oil and 1 can pumpkin, until well combined.</li>
        <li>Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and whisk until smooth. Transfer to prepared baking dish and bake at 350ËšF for 35-40 min (my oven took 35 mins), or until a toothpick poked in the center comes out clean. Let cake cool completely in pan then spread the top with frosting (see below) and decorate with pecans or sprinkles.</li>
    </ol>
